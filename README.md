# CS 166 Final Project — Phishing & Scam Email Detection

> **Course:** CS 166 – Information Security  
> **GitHub:** https://github.com/Lushangtu123/Phishing-Scam-Email-Detection

PhishGuard is a FastAPI web application for explainable phishing-email
screening. It supports three distinct workflows:

- sender/domain risk analysis from an email address;
- message analysis from subject/body text or a complete RFC 5322 `.eml` file;
- public-safe DNS/MX/SPF/DMARC/PTR/WHOIS domain checks, with optional local
  SMTP mailbox probing kept separate from domain evidence.

The UCI Phishing Websites model in this repository is retained as a separate
course benchmark. Its URL/HTML weights are **not** used as an email-sender
classifier, because those features do not represent the same input domain.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the dated change history.

## Detection design

### Sender/domain mode

The address endpoint accepts a single address with an unquoted ASCII local part
and a dotted hostname (including internationalized domain names). Plain text,
multiple addresses and unsupported syntax return HTTP 400 without a risk verdict;
use full-message input for message text or display-name headers. Plus-addresses
and the IP-domain detection examples remain supported.

Sender scoring uses the same mailbox syntax validator as the address endpoint
and the full-message From parser. Supported [RFC 5322 atom punctuation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322#section-3.2.3),
such as `#`, `=`, `/` and apostrophes, does not add an invalid-format or
special-character risk signal. Leading, trailing and repeated local-part dots
remain invalid. This is the application's supported syntax contract, not a
claim of support for every RFC mailbox form.

Complete routine role names such as `subscriptions`, `updates`, and `admin`
do not create a high-risk keyword signal by themselves. Domain impersonation
and other message evidence still apply; compound mailbox names such as
`verify-account` keep the normal keyword checks.

Sender-only and full-message checks use the same IDNA domain normalization.
Unicode/Punycode spellings and a trailing root dot share the same scoring rules;
the submitted address is retained in sender-only responses for display.
The local verification endpoint uses the same address validation and normalization;
DNS, SMTP, and WHOIS receive the canonical domain/address while responses retain
the submitted address for display. Unsupported syntax is rejected before DNS.

`POST /api/analyze-email` returns an explainable `risk_score`, not a trained
probability. Signals include:

- look-alike brand names and phishing keywords in untrusted domains;
- decisive digit-substitution lookalikes such as `paypa1.com` and `g00gle.com`;
- risky TLDs, IP-literal domains, excessive subdomains, and unusual syntax;
- confirmed disposable-provider domains, separated from privacy relays;
- anchored disposable-domain patterns and multi-factor auto-generated mailbox
  patterns, reported as suspicion rather than proof;
- provider-aware plus-address aliases and Gmail-compatible dot normalization
  without added risk.

Disposable-email results include `disposable_status`,
`disposable_confidence`, `matched_provider_domain`, and
`address_alias_type`. A domain-list match confirms only the provider category;
it does not establish how long an individual mailbox exists or that its sender
is malicious.

The disposable-provider registry is stored in
`website/data/disposable_domains.json` with a schema version, release version,
entry count, and provenance note. Runtime startup validates that it is sorted,
duplicate-free, syntactically valid, and internally consistent. To rebuild it
from reviewed offline line files, run:

```bash
python website/tools/build_disposable_registry.py \
  --input /path/to/reviewed-domains.txt \
  --output website/data/disposable_domains.json \
  --version YYYY.MM.DD \
  --provenance "source name, URL, retrieval date, and license"
```

Review generated changes before committing them. Gmail and Outlook account age
or intended lifetime cannot be inferred from an address alone; random-looking
mailboxes remain heuristic suspicion rather than confirmed disposable accounts.

An optional service-retained observation history can add a second, independent
piece of context. Full raw-message analysis records that a canonical sender was
observed. Address-only analysis deliberately does not query retained history,
preventing the public sender form from becoming an arbitrary history lookup.
A first observation means only “not previously retained by this service” — it does **not** mean
the Gmail, Outlook, or other provider account was newly created. Previous
observation is also not a safety signal and never reduces phishing risk.

The history store receives only an HMAC-SHA-256 identifier, timestamps, and a
bounded count. Public API responses expose only the coarse first/previous status,
not exact observation timestamps or counts. Raw addresses and message content are not stored.
Valid plus tags share one history identity only for known supporting providers
(`gmail.com`, `googlemail.com`, `outlook.com`, `hotmail.com`, and `live.com`),
while Gmail/Googlemail dot aliases are also normalized. Unknown custom domains
keep their literal local part because their delivery semantics are not known.
Records expire after 90 days by default, and unavailable storage fails open
without changing the detector verdict. Rotating `SENDER_HISTORY_HMAC_KEY` starts
a new observation namespace; old opaque records expire under their existing TTL.

HMAC identifiers are **pseudonymization, not anonymization**. The deployment
operator remains responsible for an appropriate privacy notice, access control,
retention policy, and any legal obligations that apply to sender observations.

Privacy relays are maintained separately in
`website/data/privacy_relay_domains.json`, with provider-source URLs and a
retrieval date. Registrable-domain and subdomain calculations use
`tldextract`'s bundled Public Suffix List snapshot with runtime downloads and
cache writes disabled, so domains such as `company.co.uk` are parsed correctly
and deployment behavior stays deterministic.

Confirmed disposable-provider and privacy-relay matches are informational and
do not add phishing-risk points on their own. Independent address, domain,
link, and message risks still contribute normally. The UI separates mailbox
service type from sender risk, uses a neutral low-score banner, and does not
present `100 - risk_score` as a safety score. Scores remain heuristic and have
not been calibrated as phishing probabilities.

Apple's dedicated relay domains `privaterelay.appleid.com` and
`private.icloud.com` are recognized as privacy relays, following
[Apple's domain update](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1ptvdtcm).
Ordinary `icloud.com` accounts cannot be classified as relay addresses from
the domain alone.

The response declares `analysis_method: sender-domain-heuristics` so callers do
not confuse the score with model confidence. A low sender score does not prove a
message is safe; compromised legitimate accounts require full-message analysis.

The browser only displays responses for the current input. Editing, clearing,
or starting another analysis invalidates older responses, including mailbox
verification. HTTP failures appear separately from detector verdicts; rate-limit
errors use `Retry-After` when supplied. Selecting a content example clears any
uploaded email, and analysis waits while a selected file is still being read.

### Full-message mode

`POST /api/analyze-content` accepts `subject` and `body`, or `raw_email` for a
complete message represented as Unicode text. For original files, use
`POST /api/analyze-eml` with the unchanged bytes and `Content-Type: message/rfc822`
(or `application/octet-stream`). API-only clients can use this byte-preserving endpoint. The browser uses the visual submission route described below.
The manual `subject` field is always literal text; HTML parsing applies only to
the manual body. A MIME subject is likewise treated as literal text.

Phrase checks keep the `n't` ending of English negative contractions together,
including straight and curly apostrophes: `You won't` does not match the
financial-lure phrase `You won`. Genuine winning phrases, possessives and
quoted words still match. This tailors Python's ordinary word-character
boundary for contractions; it is not general linguistic or negation analysis.
See [Python's regex definition](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/re.html) and
[Unicode's apostrophe guidance](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Apostrophe).

The legacy binary endpoint is limited to **60,000 bytes**, checked while the server consumes the request stream. No file is saved or forwarded
to a third-party analysis service.

When `raw_email` is non-empty, the file's subject and decoded body are authoritative;
manual `subject`/`body` fields are ignored, including when a raw field is empty.
The browser disables manual fields while a file is selected. Empty uploads are
rejected, but messages containing only headers or attachments can be analyzed.
Unsupported MIME charsets fall back to UTF-8 replacement decoding; the response
includes `message_structure.parse_warnings` and an informational UI warning, not
a silent complete-analysis claim. Invalid encoded byte sequences also produce a
warning. Original bytes are decoded using each MIME part's charset; UTF-8,
GB18030, Latin-1, base64 and quoted-printable cases have regression coverage.
Legacy JSON text cannot recover bytes already lost by a caller's earlier decoding.

MIME text parts are inspected independently with their declared type: literal
plain text is not parsed as HTML, and unclosed markup, forms, or base addresses
cannot affect another MIME part. Recovered parser defects (including missing or
truncated multipart boundaries) are included in `parse_warnings`.
Duplicate `From`, `Subject`, `Reply-To`, and `Return-Path` fields and parsed header
defects also mark analysis incomplete. All duplicate candidates remain available
in `message_structure.header_candidates`; sender and identity checks retain the
highest-risk candidate, subjects are scanned together, and mismatching reply or
return domains remain visible. Duplicates do not add a phishing score by themselves.
Visible `To` and `Cc` recipients are also parsed. A sender mailbox repeated in
`To` or `Cc` adds one bounded low-risk structure point; a missing visible
recipient is informational because legitimate Bcc delivery is possible.
Within a single address-list field, each mailbox/display-name pair is checked
independently; adding another sender cannot hide a detected brand impersonation.
Quoted commas in display names remain part of that name, not an address separator.
Legitimately repeatable `Received` and `Authentication-Results` fields are not
flagged just because they repeat.
Each MIME part also checks duplicate `Content-Type`, `Content-Transfer-Encoding`,
and `Content-Disposition` headers. These always mark analysis incomplete. The
original interpretation and up to **8 alternate combinations per part**, with
**32 alternates per independently analyzed message**, are inspected for recoverable
text and attachment metadata. Candidate exhaustion is reported. Alternate MIME
trees and encapsulated messages are not reparsed; this is bounded evidence
recovery, not a claim that every possible interpretation was checked.
For `multipart/alternative`, the text model scores rendered plain/HTML choices
separately and retains the highest-risk scored view instead of concatenating
mutually exclusive versions into one model input. Mixed parts remain together
in each view. At most **16 MIME view combinations** are attempted; candidate
exhaustion or a view the model cannot score marks the analysis incomplete.
Heuristic and destination checks still inspect every part.
The content response includes `analysis_complete`; `false` means some content
could not be reliably analyzed, not evidence of phishing by itself. Attachment
items include `inspection_status`: `metadata_only` means the filename and MIME
type were checked but attachment bytes were not inspected;
`message_analyzed` means an encapsulated email was successfully traversed under
the existing detector limits. Non-text inline parts without filenames are also
reported as `metadata_only`. Opaque attachment content adds one bounded
top-level `analysis_warnings` entry, separate from MIME `parse_warnings`, but no
phishing points. If there is no detected risk and analysis is incomplete
(except the text-rich remote-image case below), `risk_level` is `unknown` and
`combined_phishing_score` is `null`. The UI shows “Analysis Incomplete” and a dash
instead of a green zero. Detected risks remain visible alongside the warning.
API consumers must accept this additional risk level and nullable score.
HTML `data:image/...` references in image elements, `srcset`, and CSS `url()`
are reported separately as top-level `inline_image_coverage`, including
recognized images in analyzed attached emails. Its count is capped at 20;
`inspection_status=metadata_only` means the image content was
not inspected. These references add no phishing points, but add one analysis
warning and prevent a complete Safe verdict. An otherwise Safe result becomes
Unknown with a null combined score; independent high-risk evidence stays
visible. MIME image attachments remain in `message_structure.attachments`.

MSO conditional comments are inspected for text, links, password forms, and
image references using one bounded expansion layer. Ordinary comments and
solely negated MSO comments remain inert. Recognized MSO branches, including
nested or malformed conditional content, carry an incomplete-analysis warning because client-specific rendering
is not verified. The text model abstains on these HTML views; independent rule,
link, and structure findings still apply, and other covered MIME views can
still be scored.

Remote `img`, `srcset`, VML `v:imagedata`/`v:fill` (including MSO conditional
comments except solely negated `!mso` blocks; compound conditions are counted
conservatively), SVG `image`, CSS, and
HTML table/background image references,
including relative references under a remote `<base>`, have a separate top-level
`remote_image_coverage` count (also capped at 20) and a distinct warning: the
image bytes were not inspected. A short visible HTML part (under 80
non-whitespace characters) with a remote image cannot receive a complete Safe
verdict, even if another MIME alternative contains longer text, and
becomes Unknown if no other risk was found. Text-rich mail with ordinary remote
imagery keeps the verdict from the inspected text but is explicitly marked
incomplete; a Safe label then says it applies only to inspected text. This
exception avoids treating every decorative logo as an undetermined message.
API-only MIME analysis does not decode image pixels. The browser can supplement it
with QR/OCR extraction (see below). Neither path fetches remote images; remote
destinations still receive the existing URL checks.
`cid:` and image references without a usable remote base are reported in
`unresolved_image_coverage` (capped at 20), with their own incomplete-analysis
warning. The detector does not assume these image bytes are available merely
because the HTML names them.

MIME tree construction is limited to **200 message/part nodes per upload**,
including the root. This bounds deeply nested and very wide messages before
content analysis. On reaching the limit (or a parser recursion failure), the
detector falls back to outer headers only and explicitly marks the body and
attachments uninspected. Outer-header risk is retained; an otherwise risk-free
fallback is `unknown`, never a complete safe verdict. This is separate from the
attached-message analysis depth/count limits below. Long monetary digit strings
are compared without integer conversion, and monetary evidence excerpts are bounded.
Amount checks distinguish common decimal and three-digit grouping formats
(`$100.00`, `$10,000.00`, `EUR 10.000,00`); malformed grouping is ignored rather
than converted to an inflated integer. This is a heuristic, not currency or locale inference.

Malformed HTML that requires parser recovery now reports `analysis_warnings`
and `analysis_complete=false`, including manual subject/body input and nested
messages. Recovery attempts to retain text, links, and forms; if necessary it
falls back to literal text. A parsing failure is neither a server-error verdict
nor proof that the content is safe. Literal MIME `text/plain` is not parsed as HTML.
Unknown marked declarations such as `<![foo]>` explicitly trigger recovery,
even on Python versions that would silently consume them as comments. Literal
markers inside comments, quoted attributes, scripts, and styles do not trigger
this check; supported CDATA and conditional declarations remain accepted.
Visible-text extraction also handles an omitted `</head>` when body content
begins, while retaining suppression of title, script/style, and template content.
This is targeted recovery, not a complete browser DOM or CSS rendering engine.
`textarea` and `xmp` contents remain literal text across the text, link, form,
image, and conditional-comment collectors: markup written inside them cannot
hide visible instructions or invent active forms/images. Character references
are decoded once in `textarea` (RCDATA) and retained in `xmp` (RAWTEXT).
Unclosed elements retain their text through end of input; the slash in
`<textarea/>` or `<xmp/>` does not close them. The same token handling keeps
`title` content hidden until its actual closing tag. This does not establish
how an individual mail client sanitizes these elements.

Encapsulated `message/rfc822` attachments (and parseable `message/global` parts)
are analyzed as independent messages, including their subject, sender identity,
body, and attachments. Nested analysis is limited to **3 levels and 20 messages
per upload**; exceeding either limit produces an incomplete-analysis warning.
Their authentication headers are never trusted using the outer message's
`TRUSTED_AUTHSERV_IDS`. Results include `message_structure.nested_messages`, and
indicators carry an “Attached message” prefix. The highest nested score/risk is
preserved rather than adding the same content repeatedly. Opaque `.eml` files
declared as generic binary attachments are reported as uninspected, not silently
treated as fully checked. Encapsulated messages using base64, quoted-printable,
or other unsupported transfer encodings also produce an incomplete-analysis
warning rather than a complete verdict. Ambiguous duplicate MIME interpretations
or indistinguishable attachment names never claim `message_analyzed`. A parsed
attached email can still contain its own `metadata_only` attachment, making the
outer result incomplete. This does not unpack archives or execute attachments.

Raw input enables these checks:

- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results from explicitly trusted authentication servers.
  An uploaded `.eml` can also name the mailbox it was downloaded from (currently
  Gmail). Only the topmost `Authentication-Results` header is then trusted, and
  only if that service wrote it; headers below it, which a sender can add, are
  ignored. A trusted DMARC pass for the single From domain, when that domain is
  an organization's own sending domain in the official-brand registries, marks a
  **verified official sender**. Consumer mailbox domains such as qq.com, icloud.com
  or gmail.com never qualify.
  - Address-shape sender heuristics are then not scored.
  - The text model or weak rules alone cannot raise the message above
    "Low Risk — Verified Official Sender".
  - Lookalike links, dangerous attachments, requests for codes, and other evidence
    that sets a Medium or higher floor still alert.
- protected-brand display-name and Unicode/IDN domain impersonation; display
  names use word boundaries to avoid matching ordinary names such as Appleton
  or Pineapple, while retaining detection of spaced, punctuated, and Unicode
  lookalikes such as `A p p l e` and `Аpple`;
- bank, payment, telecom, logistics, e-commerce, platform, airline and
  government names in the From display name (for example 中国工商银行, 12306,
  Wells Fargo, HMRC or DHL Express) sent from a domain outside that
  organization's official domains. The registries are
  `website/data/official_brands_cn.json` (39 Chinese organizations) and
  `website/data/official_brands_intl.json` (32 US, UK, Canadian, Australian
  and global organizations). Their domains were confirmed on each
  organization's own site, and their "we will never ask…" statements are
  source-linked. Government names also accept their country's government
  domains (gov.cn, .gov, gov.uk, gc.ca, gov.au). A matching domain proves
  nothing on its own, because From is not authenticated, so a match only
  avoids this signal;
- From / Reply-To / Return-Path domain mismatches;
- the same sender/domain heuristics used by the sender-only workflow;
- executable, macro-enabled, disk-image, and archive attachment extensions or
  MIME types;
- HTML anchor/form targets, Markdown, and plain-text link destinations, including displayed-host
  mismatch, Unicode/IDN and ASCII digit-substitution lookalikes, URL userinfo,
  deceptive brand subdomains, and credential-themed domains;
- IP-based and shortened URLs, urgency, credential requests, threats, and
  character obfuscation.

Link checks parse destinations before inspecting hosts. HTML entity escapes,
protocol-relative targets, IPv6, and integer/hex/octal IPv4 forms retain their
destination evidence. No link is fetched to perform these checks. Generic
login/account words on an unrecognized hostname are weak context, not a standalone
high-risk verdict; brand impersonation, userinfo deception, and explicit
credential-collection wording retain stronger signals.
Displayed-host mismatch requires a presented address: an HTTP(S)/`www.` address,
a bare address label with an optional port/path, or an explicit navigation
instruction such as “visit” or “log in at.” A publisher domain mentioned in an
article title and dotted release numbers such as `5.0` or `802.11b` do not alone
establish a mismatch. Full IPv4 labels and explicitly displayed legacy IP URLs
remain eligible. Actual destinations are still checked independently; no tracking
domain is allowlisted and no redirect is followed.
Complete bare filenames such as `invoice.pdf` and `report.docx` do not claim a
display domain when their extension is absent from the bundled public suffix
list. Explicit addresses, navigation instructions, paths/ports and real
file-like domain suffixes such as `.zip` and `.mov` retain mismatch checks.
HTML text, destination, form, and image collectors retain the first occurrence
of a repeated attribute, including an empty value, matching HTML parsing rules.
Later duplicate `action`, `formaction`, `href`, `type`, or image attributes cannot
override the effective value during analysis.

HTTP(S) authority slash/backslash variants are normalized before resolving an
HTML base URL, so equivalent destinations keep the same host checks. Unsupported
or malformed HTTP(S) destinations produce incomplete-analysis warnings rather
than silently disappearing. This normalization is not a full WHATWG URL engine.

Text rules decode HTML entities, preserve words across inline tags, and normalize
whitespace independently of destination analysis. Script/style/comment text is
not treated as visible prose. The content model now receives this same
MIME-aware visible text rather than raw HTML. Text under the HTML `hidden`
attribute or inline `display:none` / `visibility:hidden` / `opacity:0` is also excluded from
text rules and model input; a warning marks the result incomplete when such
text is present. Literal `opacity:calc(0)` is handled the same way. Inline
`visibility:visible` can restore a child of a
`visibility:hidden` element, but not a child of `display:none` or `opacity:0`.
Stylesheet rules containing `display:none`, `visibility:hidden`/`collapse`, or
`opacity:0`, zero `font-size`, or transparent text color are detected
conservatively, including inside media-rule blocks. Inline zero `font-size` and
transparent text color also mark rendering uncertain. Other `calc(...)` opacity
expressions are left unscored when their visible result cannot be established.
Because selector matching and CSS cascade are not fully rendered, the API sets
`ml_status=unverified_rendering` and leaves model scores null when every MIME
view is uncertain. A separate trustworthy text/plain alternative may still be
model-scored, but the whole-message analysis remains incomplete and cannot
produce a complete Low or Safe verdict. Prose from only the CSS-uncertain HTML
part is withheld from text rules, including bare URLs and displayed link labels;
unambiguous MIME parts still contribute text rules. Explicit link destinations,
forms, sender, and message-structure checks still run.
This is not a browser renderer: external CSS and other visual-hiding methods
are not fully resolved, so even a complete result does not establish pixel-level
visibility. MIME `text/plain` remains literal. HTML
anchor labels and free-text URL scans use this visible text; a hidden naked URL
is not treated as a link. Raw HTML is still used for actual `href`, `action`,
and `formaction` destinations even inside hidden subtrees; opaque image data-URI
payloads do not become link destinations. Shortener checks use decoded destination hosts with
domain boundaries rather than substrings anywhere in a message. Form `action`
and submit-control `formaction` targets are inspected; an enabled password field
associated with a form is medium-risk evidence, not proof that a client executes it.
Relative HTML link and form targets are resolved against the document's first
`base href` when it supplies a usable HTTP(S) address, including a protocol-relative base. No base is
inferred from the sender, and no external resource is fetched. Without a usable
base, relative targets cannot identify a destination host. Medium and high
destination-risk floors are both preserved when results are combined.

An HTML `<img>` with nonempty `alt` and no usable `src` or `srcset` contributes
its replacement text to rule and model input, unless the image is hidden. For
images that may load, a substantive `alt` (at least three words and 12
non-whitespace characters, or a substantial no-space non-Latin passage) is
conditional fallback content: its presence
prevents model scoring of the affected MIME view and produces an incomplete-
analysis warning, without assuming the image fails or treating that alternative
as always visible. When no other trustworthy view can be scored,
`ml_status=unverified_rendering`.
Short instructions requesting credentials, such as “Enter password,” are also
treated as conditional fallback content.
Short decorative labels such as “Company logo” do not disable the text model;
this is a coverage heuristic, not a guarantee that shorter `alt` text is safe.
Usable `<picture>` sources also keep `alt` conditional. Image pixels are still not
decoded or OCR-scanned.

Any positive rule score retains at least a low-risk verdict instead of claiming
no indicators. A narrow English combination of urgency, threats, and a direct
credential request establishes a high-risk floor. Direct negations and ordinary
password-reset notices have negative-control tests; this is not full natural-language
understanding and does not eliminate false positives or false negatives.

An English and Chinese rule flags requests to **hand over** something official
organizations never ask for by email, whatever the urgency:
- one-time or verification codes (sent, replied, read out);
- passwords or PINs;
- backup codes, seed phrases or private keys;
- gift card numbers, or gift cards as payment that must then be sent;
- moving funds or crypto to a "new" or "safe" wallet or account;
- installing remote-access software or sharing the screen.

The rule adds one High-floor signal and lists each kind as its own indicator. It
does not flag:
- genuine code emails ("enter this code on the sign-in page");
- reminders ("never share this code", 请勿告知他人);
- warnings quoting scammers ("if anyone asks you to…");
- retail gift cards;
- noun phrases such as "email password".

The default content rules are English-oriented. The optional model now has a
dated Spanish holdout, but that single corpus is not representative of Gmail,
Outlook, Chinese-language mail, or organization-specific traffic. Pure-text
credential lures can still be missed. Do not interpret passing regression tests
or a zero score as universal measured phishing recall.
Substantial visible Han-script text, including supplementary-plane ideographs,
now adds a language-coverage warning and prevents an unqualified complete Safe
result. It does not add phishing points or
pretend that an English-oriented model has learned Chinese phishing patterns.
When a substantial body produces no fitted vectorizer features, the model
abstains even if an English subject has features. It also checks a substantial
non-Latin-script segment in both subject and body separately, so English
padding cannot stand in for an unrepresented Chinese, Japanese, or Cyrillic passage. The
current segment gate requires at least 12 letters in a same-script passage and
zero fitted features; numbers and symbols cannot stand in for those letters.
Scattered foreign names separated by English text do not form one passage,
but a long list without intervening Latin text may conservatively abstain.
Shorter passages can still receive a model score. Independent sender,
link, rule, and structure findings still apply. These coverage gates do not
establish detection accuracy in those languages.

If the fitted vectorizer produces no usable feature for a message or for a
substantial body/segment, the model abstains with
`ml_status=insufficient_feature_coverage` and nullable model
scores instead of inventing a prediction. Rules, sender, link, and structure
checks still run. The model also abstains with `ml_status=insufficient_context`
before vectorization when the combined subject and body contain fewer than five
Unicode word tokens or fewer than 40 non-whitespace characters; hidden HTML tags
and attributes in HTML parts do not count toward this context measure. This
prevents short routine
subjects from producing unsupported high-confidence verdicts.
This input change leaves the committed artifact and threshold unchanged.
Constructed hidden-text controls and the existing committed-model controls pass,
but the stored offline metrics were measured on their original input pipeline;
they are not a fresh evaluation of this HTML-serving behavior or provider-specific
recall.
With no independent evidence, or with only weak rule points that would otherwise
make it Low, either abstention produces an incomplete `unknown` result rather
than claiming the email is safe or low risk. Medium and higher findings from
rules, sender, links or structure still produce an alert. The UI labels supported
outputs as a **model risk score**, not a calibrated probability or confidence claim.
Model classification, MIME-view selection, and final risk fusion use the original
unrounded model score. API display scores remain rounded to one decimal place;
rounding cannot change a threshold decision or select a lower-scoring MIME view.
A model score above the threshold with no rule, sender, link or structure
evidence (`fusion_basis=model_only`) is an alert labelled **Medium Risk — Model
Signal Needs Review**. Real 2023 account and security notices reach this state
often (see [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md)). With weak rule evidence
(`model_led`) the model score raises the message to High for review. The model
cannot produce Critical by itself: Critical requires corroborating rule,
sender or structure evidence, or a sufficiently strong heuristic score. This
changes severity only. Medium still counts as an alert, the model's score is not
lowered, and it is not a validated reduction in Gmail/Outlook false positives.

Safety-footer phrases such as “unsubscribe” and “privacy policy” are reported
as context but never subtract risk: an attacker can copy them. Regional English
phrasing is not scored as malicious.

### Optional text classifier

The web service defaults to rules-only analysis. When `CONTENT_MODEL_ENABLED=true`,
the content endpoint loads a SHA-256-verified offline artifact containing the
word and character n-gram TF-IDF classifier. Web startup never downloads data or
trains a model. Its offline evaluation pipeline is designed around missed-phishing
risk:

1. Messages are normalized across all sources before splitting; duplicate
   families are removed and label-conflicting families are excluded.
2. Source-record/template IDs and PhishNChips campaign URLs receive group IDs;
   corpora without usable metadata use source-independent normalized hashes.
3. The held-out split and model-selection folds use `StratifiedGroupKFold`.
4. Models are selected by cross-validated PR AUC, which is more informative for
   imbalanced phishing detection than ROC AUC alone.
5. TF-IDF is fitted inside each cross-validation pipeline, preventing vocabulary
   leakage.
6. The initial phishing decision threshold is selected from training-fold
   out-of-fold predictions by maximizing F2, which weights recall more heavily.
   When available, a separate 2024 SpaPhish validation slice replaces that
   initial threshold with the maximum-recall point whose legitimate-message
   false-positive rate is at most 20%. This is an observed validation-sample
   constraint, not a guarantee about the population false-positive rate.
7. Dated SpaPhish messages from 2025 form a post-selection regression slice and
   are scored after model and threshold selection. Reports include phishing recall,
   false-negative and false-positive rates, PR AUC, Brier score, threshold,
   split strategy, train/test group overlap, and Wilson 95% intervals for recall
   and false-positive rate. Repeated inspection means this slice is not claimed
   as a permanently untouched production lockbox.

Structural/rule evidence and ML evidence are fused conservatively: weak model
evidence cannot average away a strong authentication or message-structure
signal.

### Message codes

Every server-written English message also carries a stable, dotted `code` and
its `params` (short strings or numbers, each at most 256 characters; never a
message body), so clients can show it in another language. The English text is
unchanged:

- `risk_indicators[]` and `extra_indicators[]` add `code` and `params` next to
  `level`/`msg`. A message wrapped with its source (`Sender: …`,
  `Attached message: …`, `Image (name): …`) keeps the inner code and lists the
  wrappers in `prefixes` (`[{code, params}]`, outermost first).
- String lists keep their type and gain parallel lists of `{code, params, msg}`:
  `analysis_warning_details`, `safety_signal_details`, per-image
  `assessment_warning_details` and the enhancement's `warning_details`.
  `code` is `null` for text the server did not write, such as browser OCR
  warnings.
- `/api/verify-email` adds `code`/`params` to `spf`, `dmarc`, `domain_age` and
  `mx_ptr`, `smtp_message_code`/`smtp_message_params`, `note_code`/`note_params`
  and `mailbox_verification.reason_code`/`reason_params`.

```json
{"level": "low", "code": "sender.domain_hyphen", "params": {"domain": "paypa1-verify.xyz"},
 "msg": "Domain contains a hyphen (paypa1-verify.xyz) — major providers typically do not use hyphens in their domains"}
```

The catalogue of codes and English templates is
[`website/data/server_messages.json`](website/data/server_messages.json)
(families `sender.`, `content.`, `link.`, `structure.`, `warning.`, `safety.`,
`prefix.`, `verify.`); `msg` is always rendered from it. The homepage dictionary
holds the same English as `server.<code>`, and
`website/static/server-messages.test.mjs` fails when the two differ. Saved cases
keep indicator codes but not the `*_details` lists; case reads (`GET /api/cases/{id}`
and responses that return a record) derive a top-level `analysis_warning_details`
(and `source_preview.warning_details` for retained feedback email) again for
display, outside the stored `analysis`.

The case workspace (`/cases`) uses the same dictionary and EN / 中文 switch as the
homepage and shares its stored choice (`localStorage` `phishguard-lang`). It
localizes its own interface text, coded indicators and warnings (English-match
check), risk labels and levels, category labels and descriptions, statuses,
verdicts, review reasons, evidence bases, report types, history action and field
names, and reported signal codes. Analyst notes, subjects, message bodies, actor
names, API `detail` errors and the audit JSON are shown as stored.

Only the active language's strings are downloaded. `website/static/i18n.js`
holds the runtime and the English dictionary (the fallback, and the reference
for the English-match check); the Chinese dictionary is `i18n-zh.js`. For a
visitor whose language resolves to Chinese, `lang-init.js` requests it in
`<head>` and the page stays hidden until it is applied (or has failed, in which
case the page is shown in English); switching to 中文 loads it once, on demand.
On the homepage, Chart.js is likewise fetched only when the benchmark section
nears the viewport; the benchmark table does not wait for it.

API requests from both pages go through `website/static/request.js`, which gives
up after 45 s for analyses, verification and saves (above Vercel's 30 s
`maxDuration`, after which the platform answers 504 itself) and after 15 s for
small reads (`/api/config`, `/api/metrics`, case-queue reads), with its own
"took too long" message. While a sender or content analysis runs, a Cancel
button stops it and restores the form; a response that still arrives is
ignored. A timed-out report or case creation is treated as unconfirmed and
retried with the same `Idempotency-Key`. Unknown page URLs (not `/api/…`,
`/static/…` or `/_vercel/…`, and not a client asking only for JSON) get the
`404.html` page with status 404; API and asset misses keep the JSON 404.
With JavaScript off, both pages show an English `<noscript>` notice.

Example raw-message request:

```json
{
  "raw_email": "From: Example <notice@example.com>\nReply-To: help@lookalike.example\nSubject: Action required\n\nReview your account."
}
```

Keep `TRUSTED_AUTHSERV_IDS` empty unless you know which receiving mail system
created the uploaded message's authentication results. The upstream receiver
must remove attacker-supplied copies of its own authentication-service ID before
adding its result. Untrusted header claims are returned for inspection but
cannot increase or suppress risk.
Authentication-result extraction separates semicolon-delimited method clauses
from nested comments and quoted explanation strings. Text such as `dmarc=pass`
inside a comment or `reason` cannot overwrite a real `dmarc=fail` result. Common
whitespace and method-version syntax are supported. Unclosed comments or strings
produce an incomplete-analysis warning and cannot confer a trusted pass. This
does not perform live SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification or expand the trust boundary.

The included Render blueprint explicitly sets `CONTENT_MODEL_ENABLED=false`
and `ENABLE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=false`. The public
demo therefore starts reliably with sender, header, structure, and content-rule
analysis, without presenting a synthetic model as production evidence.

## Vercel Hobby deployment

The repository root is a Vercel-native FastAPI project. Its committed profile
uses one Fluid-compute Python Function, four bounded verification workers, and
`VERIFICATION_MODE=lite`. Lite mode performs format, MX/A/AAAA, SPF, DMARC, PTR,
and best-effort WHOIS checks. It never opens an SMTP connection and returns
`overall=domain_valid` rather than claiming that the mailbox or sender is
verified. The response separates `domain_verification` from
`mailbox_verification`; the latter is `unavailable` on this profile.

The Vercel runtime installs pinned NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, joblib, and
threadpoolctl versions for inference but not pandas. These are the versions
validated by the current serving smoke test; the committed model predates
dependency-version recording, so they do not prove its original training
environment. Training remains local-only. When the artifact at
`website/model/content_model_artifact.pkl` is present, `vercel.json` must
contain its exact SHA-256 digest and enable the model. The committed artifact
was saved with scikit-learn 1.9.0. Both the Vercel runtime and local
evaluation requirements pin that exact version.
Startup verifies the digest before deserializing and rejects scikit-learn
estimator version warnings, including patch-version mismatches. New artifacts
record the full scikit-learn version, Python version, and exact versions of the
core numerical dependencies. The loaders reject a recorded runtime dependency
mismatch before serving predictions. Legacy artifacts without this metadata
remain loadable, but cannot establish numerical-dependency parity with their
training run. A rejected or missing artifact leaves rule and structure
analysis available and reports the model error through
`/health`. Successful health and metrics responses expose the loaded artifact
digest and a short `model_id`, so displayed metrics can be tied to the
deployed binary rather than a different training run.

The `/health` response also exposes the full Git commit SHA from Vercel's
`VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` system environment variable. Enable System Environment
Variables in the Vercel project settings if that field is null. The production
deployment smoke check requires this SHA to match the deployment event before
it sends analysis controls; an alias still serving older code will fail the
check even when the model artifact has not changed.

Model explanations cache their immutable 80,000-feature name/coefficient arrays
and calculate contributors directly from the sparse request vector. This keeps
the displayed terms unchanged without allocating one dense feature array for
every request.

Before attaching a custom domain, add its apex and optional `www` hostname to
the Vercel `CUSTOM_DOMAINS` environment variable, for example
`phishguard.example,www.phishguard.example`, and redeploy. Do not include a URL
scheme or path. The default `*.vercel.app` allow-list remains active.

Deploy from the repository root with Vercel CLI 48.1.8 or newer, or import the
Git repository in the Vercel dashboard. The deployment is intended for a
personal/course demonstration. It always keeps a bounded in-memory limiter; when
the optional Upstash configuration is ready, POST requests also use an atomic,
HMAC-keyed distributed limit shared by Vercel instances. Upstash failure fails
open to the existing local limiter so detection remains available.
Shared limiting can be enabled with `DISTRIBUTED_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true` while
`SENDER_HISTORY_ENABLED=false`; configure the dedicated Redis variables above or
reuse the Upstash connection with a private `RATE_LIMIT_HMAC_KEY`. This does not
create sender observations. Explicitly enabled but malformed limiter settings
block API mutations and report `distributed_rate_limit_status=configuration_error`
in `/health`, rather than silently removing the requested shared budget.
`configured` describes configuration readiness, not continuous Redis reachability.
When the shared service times out, the local limiter remains the fallback.
CI uses its isolated Redis service to exercise the production limiter's Lua
through the same Upstash-style pipeline request shape, including concurrent
limits, minute/hour TTLs and independent routes. For a local run, set
`PHISHGUARD_TEST_REDIS_PORT` only to an existing trusted localhost Redis port;
the integration case skips when it is unset. It uses random HMAC-derived keys
and deletes them afterward. A skipped local case does not prove Redis behavior.

In-process budgets group case paths together and unknown API paths together,
so arbitrary IDs and unknown paths cannot create unlimited buckets. At hard
capacity, new client groups are denied until an expired slot is reclaimed;
active budgets are never evicted. This can temporarily deny new clients under
capacity pressure. Parsing, sender-candidate selection, content rules and model prediction run in a bounded
worker pool so long analysis does not block the ASGI event loop. Saturation returns
503 with `Retry-After: 1`; it does not queue unbounded work or change risk scoring.
The Vercel profile uses only a single syntactically valid platform-normalized
`X-Forwarded-For` address as the local-limit identity; ambiguous lists and
invalid values fall back to the ASGI peer. Other deployment profiles ignore
that header rather than trusting arbitrary forwarding input.

Email bodies and attachment content are processed server-side for analysis and
are not retained by this application. When sender history is enabled, a
pseudonymous sender observation may be retained as described above. Users
should remove unrelated personal content before submitting an email.

### Optional free sender-history store

[Upstash Redis currently offers a $0 tier for hobby projects](https://upstash.com/pricing/redis),
and Vercel can provision and link it through the
[Upstash Marketplace integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/upstash).
Limits and pricing can change, so confirm the current plan before provisioning.
The detector remains fully usable without this optional store.

1. In the Vercel project, open **Storage**, choose **Create Database**, select
   **Upstash Redis**, choose the Free plan, and connect it to this project.
2. Confirm Vercel added `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and
   `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` for the Production environment.
3. Generate a private HMAC key locally with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Add the
   output as `SENDER_HISTORY_HMAC_KEY` in Vercel; do not put it in Git.
4. Add `SENDER_HISTORY_ENABLED=true`. Optionally set retention and timeout using
   the variables in the configuration table above.
5. Redeploy, then confirm `/health` reports
   `sender_history_enabled: true`, `sender_history_configured: true`, and
   `sender_history_available: true`.

Missing, partial, malformed, or unreachable configuration disables only history
evidence. Analysis continues, and the UI reports history as unavailable rather
than treating an absent result as “never seen.”
The `configured` and backward-compatible `available` fields describe startup
configuration readiness; they are not a continuous Upstash reachability probe.

Vercel production `deployment_status` events run
`.github/workflows/post-deploy-smoke.yml`. The workflow checks out the deployed
revision and validates `/health`, `/api/config`, the exact model ID, phishing and
legitimate controls, and a unique first/previous sender-history probe against the
public production alias. It rejects cross-host redirects and non-JSON responses,
so Vercel SSO pages cannot be mistaken for application health output.
Read-only health/config readiness checks retry briefly while a deployment alias
converges; phishing, legitimate, and sender-history POST controls run exactly
once after the expected model and configuration are ready.
With `--check-frontend` (enabled in the workflow) it also checks what browsers
receive from the production alias: homepage and `/cases` CSP (`script-src
'self'`, `style-src 'self'`, no `'unsafe-inline'`) and `nosniff`; `br`/`gzip`/`zstd`
compression and the versioned-asset `Cache-Control` (`public, max-age=86400`;
Vercel strips `stale-while-revalidate` from browser responses) on `style.css`,
`i18n.js` and `app-core.js`; an uncached HTML 404 page for unknown page URLs and a JSON
404 for unknown `/api/` paths; and `no-store` plus `noindex` on `/cases`. Every
check runs and all problems are reported together.
Feature-branch pushes run CI, but the production smoke job only runs after a
successful Production deployment event. After merging a reviewed PR, check
that `/health` reports the merged commit SHA and that the production smoke job
completed successfully; a skipped branch run is not production verification.

## Python environments

Use Python **3.12** when loading or rebuilding the committed model. The artifact
loader checks Python major/minor compatibility and exact recorded numerical
package versions; installing a newer scikit-learn independently can make an
otherwise valid artifact unloadable.

All commands below run from the repository root in a dedicated virtual
environment. The entry points share the canonical serving pins in
`requirements.txt`:

| Environment | Install command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Serving | `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` | Inference and domain checks; excludes pandas/notebooks |
| Email-model research | `python -m pip install -r website/requirements.txt` | Serving stack plus pinned pandas for offline builds/evaluation |
| Development | `python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` | Research stack plus HTTP integration-test client |
| Notebook benchmark | `python -m pip install -r phishing-detection/requirements.txt` | Shared model versions plus plotting, Jupyter and UCI download tools |

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pip check
```

On Windows, activate with `.venv\Scripts\activate`. The requirement files pin
direct serving dependencies; they are **not full transitive lockfiles**. The
resolved `requirements-dev-py312-macos-arm64.lock.txt` snapshot records all 35
installed development packages from a clean Python 3.12.14 macOS arm64
environment, including transitive dependencies. To reproduce that package set
on the same platform, install it in a fresh environment instead of the direct
development requirements:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev-py312-macos-arm64.lock.txt
python -m pip check
```

This snapshot has no wheel hashes and is not a verified Linux/Windows,
Python 3.13, production deployment, or notebook-training lock. Notebook extras
retain bounded version ranges. For a training experiment, retain
`python -m pip freeze` and the Python/platform details alongside the dataset and
artifact provenance; rerun compatibility checks and evaluation when updating
dependencies. Production CI separately validates the deployment requirements.

For local research with the text model, train and package it before starting the
web service:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r website/requirements.txt
cd website
python prebuild_demo_model.py --output ../phishing-detection/data/content_model_artifact.pkl
# Copy the printed SHA-256 value into CONTENT_MODEL_ARTIFACT_SHA256.
APP_ENV=development CONTENT_MODEL_ENABLED=true \
  CONTENT_MODEL_ARTIFACT=../phishing-detection/data/content_model_artifact.pkl \
  CONTENT_MODEL_ARTIFACT_SHA256=REPLACE_WITH_PRINTED_SHA256 \
  uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Only load artifacts produced and stored by a trusted build process. The digest
is checked before deserialization, and Python/scikit-learn compatibility metadata
is validated afterward. New builds record the training environment in
`build_provenance` and the serving dependencies in the artifact envelope. Keep
the pinned runtime requirements aligned with those recorded versions when
publishing a newly built artifact; a saved artifact is rejected if its core
packages changed between training and packaging.

To opt into network-based mailbox verification locally, additionally set
`ENABLE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true`. Do not expose that endpoint anonymously.

`APP_ENV=development` allows this opt-in but does not enable it by itself.
For local mailbox checks without the optional text model, run from the repository root:

```bash
APP_ENV=development ENABLE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true CONTENT_MODEL_ENABLED=false \
  .venv/bin/uvicorn app:app --app-dir website --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Restart after changing environment variables, then reload the browser.
`GET /api/config` exposes `deployment_profile` and the independent feature flags;
the UI distinguishes local-disabled, public-disabled, and unavailable configuration.
DNS/WHOIS records and SMTP probes do not authenticate a particular email, and an
SMTP timeout does not prove whether a mailbox exists.
SMTP rejection is interpreted conservatively: a permanent `5.1.1` response means
the server reports a missing mailbox; `5.7.*` policy rejection, `5.2.2` mailbox-full,
and generic rejection remain inconclusive. `smtp_result` can now include
`policy_rejected` and `mailbox_full`. Existing `exists`/`verified` API values are
retained for compatibility but mean only that the server accepted the address,
not guaranteed delivery or sender authenticity. The UI uses “SMTP Accepted”.
See [enhanced SMTP status codes](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3463.html).

A sole Null MX (`0 .`) returns `null_mx=true`, `mx_found=false`, and
`overall=no_mail_service`, without A-record fallback or further probing. Mixed
or nonzero-preference Null MX configurations are inconclusive. Declaring no mail
service is not phishing evidence; see [RFC 7505](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7505.html#section-3).
When no MX record exists, discovery tries A and AAAA records within the shared
deadline. An IPv6-only address record can establish an implicit mail host; it
does not establish mailbox existence. Only definitive absence of both address
types yields the no-records verdict. If neither succeeds and either lookup fails
or times out, the result stays `unverifiable`. Null MX never uses this fallback.

Local verification has a **12-second response deadline**, including initial DNS
discovery. Queries use a shared pool with at most **10 outstanding jobs per
process** and no unbounded waiting queue. At capacity, discovery returns HTTP 503
with `Retry-After`; individual unavailable checks are reported explicitly.
`verification_complete=false` identifies unfinished/unavailable work. DNS timeouts
remain “Unverifiable” in the UI rather than becoming an invalid-mailbox verdict.
Each executed SPF, DMARC, WHOIS, and PTR check now carries `status`; SMTP exposes
`smtp_status`. `ok` and successful `not_found` results count as completed checks,
while `timeout`, `error`, `busy`, `unavailable`, and `skipped` do not. Completion
describes check execution, not address validity. A fast caught exception therefore
cannot produce a complete-verification claim. A partial result preserves any
SMTP evidence and visibly warns “Verification Incomplete”. Early exits such as
Null MX skip remaining checks and retain `verification_complete=false`.

SPF/DMARC TXT fragments within a DNS record are concatenated without inserting
spaces or display quotes. SPF summaries use complete mechanisms in order (including
the implicit `+` in `all`), not substrings inside domain names. DMARC summaries
read individual tags, not policy-looking text inside reporting addresses. Multiple
policy records, recognized malformed SPF term shapes, duplicate DMARC tags, and
invalid DMARC policy/percentage values report an error and incomplete verification.
These are bounded policy summaries: they do not recursively evaluate SPF
include/redirect, expand macros, implement full SPF syntax validation, or authenticate
a particular message. DMARC organizational-domain policy discovery remains unsupported.
DNS lookups use explicit lifetimes, WHOIS uses a 5-second socket timeout, and SMTP
uses a per-probe deadline with socket cleanup. Running threads cannot be forcibly
cancelled; they retain their capacity slot until they actually exit. The response
deadline is not a guarantee that every underlying network operation has stopped.

All HTTP request bodies are bounded by received bytes, including chunked JSON
requests and requests whose length header understates the body. The `.eml`
endpoint additionally retains its stricter 60,000-byte file limit.

## Data and evaluation scope

For the local public-corpus pilot, browser OCR/QR benchmarks, and reproducible
baseline comparison, see [the evaluation workflow](docs/evaluation.md). These tools
include owned CI controls and explicit data/label limitations; public raw mail and
private screenshots stay outside Git and Vercel deployments.

### UCI website benchmark

The notebook uses the [UCI Phishing Websites dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/327/phishing+websites):
11,055 rows with 30 URL, domain, and HTML features. Historical results shown in
the UI are explicitly labeled as a **website benchmark**, not email accuracy.

### Email-text corpora

The optional content model can load:

| Local file | Source/type | Automatic download |
|---|---|---:|
| `Phishing_Email.csv` | Public phishing-email mirror | Yes |
| `CEAS_08.csv` | CEAS 2008 via Zenodo | Yes |
| `Nazario.csv` | Nazario corpus via Zenodo | Yes |
| `phishnchips_*.csv` | Modern synthetic benchmark data | Yes |
| `SpaPhish.csv` | Human-annotated Spanish email corpus via Mendeley Data | Yes, SHA-256 pinned |
| `phishfuzzer_{train,val,test}.csv` | Optional local three-class export | No |

Synthetic benchmark and template data can improve coverage but do not establish
real-world effectiveness. Report metrics only with the exact `data_source`,
`split_strategy`, threshold, and false-negative rate returned by the trained
pipeline. SpaPhish provides a dated cross-language slice, but it is not a Gmail
or Outlook inbox sample and 791 training rows lack dates. A future production
evaluation still needs a strictly dated, organization- and provider-
representative holdout.

### Observed email-text evaluation — 2026-09-19

The committed Logistic Regression artifact sampled 30,000 rows from the globally
deduplicated legacy and PhishNChips pool, reserved 6,000 group-isolated rows for
the original mixed-corpus test, and then added 1,008 SpaPhish training rows plus
1,044 unique grouped synthetic legitimate hard negatives. The hard negatives span 87
transactional, workplace, and personal-correspondence template families and are
added only after the original split; 37 normalized families already present in
reserved data were excluded. SpaPhish normalized families are assigned
to their latest dated partition: 2024 supplies 128 threshold-validation messages
and 2025 supplies 211 post-selection regression-slice messages. The published
CSV is pinned to SHA-256
`fdd74842d0a19fd4332bd91f90b0bcb06e045ceb2b599051b4598b65055a9cc5`.

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Training rows | 26,052 |
| Original mixed-corpus held-out rows | 6,000 |
| Original held-out accuracy | 98.80% |
| Original held-out precision | 98.13% |
| Original held-out phishing recall | 99.32% |
| Original held-out false-negative rate | 0.68% |
| Original held-out PR AUC | 0.9994 |
| Original held-out Brier score | 0.0095 |
| Training-fold F2 threshold | 0.4352 |
| Effective threshold after 2024 validation | 0.3736 |
| Train/test group overlap | 0 |
| 2024 validation phishing recall | 86.30% (95% CI 76.59%–92.39%) |
| 2024 validation false-positive rate | 14.55% (95% CI 7.56%–26.16%) |
| 2025 SpaPhish holdout rows | 211 (179 phishing / 32 legitimate) |
| 2025 holdout accuracy | 94.31% |
| 2025 holdout precision | 96.65% |
| 2025 holdout phishing recall | 96.65% (95% CI 92.88%–98.45%) |
| 2025 holdout false-negative rate | 3.35% |
| 2025 holdout false-positive rate | 18.75% (95% CI 8.89%–35.31%) |
| 2025 holdout PR AUC | 0.9942 |
| 2025 holdout family overlap | 0 |

The 2025 labels are not used for model selection or threshold tuning, but the
slice has now been repeatedly inspected and is described as a regression slice,
not a permanently untouched holdout. The temporal guarantee remains partial
because 791 SpaPhish training rows have no usable date. These are offline corpus
results, not Gmail/Outlook production claims. PhishNChips and the added hard
negatives are synthetic, provider-specific drift remains unmeasured, and
image-only lures, QR codes, and attachment contents remain outside this
evaluation. The committed artifact is identified by SHA-256
`a0a503a0cd6122e722933add91f49cc72e3fa74abaf1129c4df3fe0450401746`.
Its metrics include the build seed, cache-policy version, training options, and
SHA-256 digest of every local source corpus used for reproducibility checks.

The mixed-corpus rows above are in-distribution: test messages have training
neighbours from the same corpora. A leave-one-source-out run of the same training
recipe ([evaluation §4](docs/evaluation.md#4-leave-one-source-out-model-evaluation))
finds much weaker transfer to unseen corpora, for example 10.6% recall on modern
synthetic phishing and a 96.5% false-positive rate on Spanish legitimate mail
when those corpora are excluded from training.

To measure the **current serving pipeline** on consented, labeled inbox mail,
use `website/tools/evaluate_serving_pipeline.py` with a local JSONL file kept
outside version control. Each line must provide `provider` (`gmail` or
`outlook`), `received_at` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `label` (`phishing` or `legitimate`),
and either `eml_path` (an absolute path to a local original `.eml` file),
`raw_email` (Unicode text), or `subject`/`body`. Do not mix `eml_path` with text
fields. The `.eml` route preserves MIME bytes and uses the same 60,000-byte limit
as the upload API; keep the JSONL and referenced files outside version control.
An optional, manually verified
`language` field accepts a lowercase two- or three-letter code such as `en`,
`es`, or `zh`; omitted language is reported as `unlabeled`. Do not infer the
language from the model prediction. Run from the repository root with
the pinned Python 3.12 environment:

```bash
.venv/bin/python website/tools/evaluate_serving_pipeline.py --input /absolute/path/to/consented-mail.jsonl
```

Add `--attribution-output /absolute/private/path/attribution.json` to write a
separate, optional aggregate diagnostic. It counts fixed content-category and
link-rule IDs, sender/structure signals, model state and uninspected-image
coverage by human label and final decision. It writes no per-message rows,
matched terms, addresses, URLs or indicator prose. Counts indicate which signals
occurred together with a decision, **not** which signal caused it; the existing
scoring, thresholds and comparison policy are unchanged. Keep the diagnostic
beside the private input, outside version control. The public-corpus evaluator
supports the same option; compare its normal report as before.

Add `--counterfactual-output /absolute/private/path/counterfactual.json` to
either evaluator to replay baseline alerts with one evidence family or targeted
link rule removed at a time. The aggregate transitions show which removals
would change an alert to a nonalert or an undetermined result, alongside the
effect on detected phishing messages. The sidecar contains fixed family names
and counts, not individual messages; overlapping transitions cannot be added
together. See
[the evaluation procedure](docs/evaluation.md#offline-counterfactual-alert-diagnostics).

Exact repeats are excluded from metrics by default (`--duplicate-policy drop`).
Use `--duplicate-policy error` to reject a cohort containing any exact duplicate.
Identity is based on effective message content within its input mode: original
bytes for `eml_path`, exact Unicode for `raw_email`, or the subject/body pair.
File paths, ignored fields, and row order are not identity. The same content
with conflicting labels, providers, received dates, or language labels is rejected
with row numbers; the evaluator does not silently pick one annotation.
This conservative policy requires resolving ambiguous repeated content before
comparing groups. It does not detect near-duplicate templates, campaigns, or the
same message supplied through different input modes, nor establish independence
from training data.

The `input_integrity` section reports input/evaluated/duplicate row counts,
the selected duplicate policy, and warnings for excluded repeats.
`dataset_sha256` uses the versioned `phishguard-evaluation-input-v1` scheme:
SHA-256 over a sorted multiset of record digests covering effective content,
input mode, label, provider, received date, and language (default `unlabeled`).
Repeated records remain in the input fingerprint even when excluded from metrics.
Reordering rows or moving an unchanged `.eml` does not change the digest; changing
its bytes or annotations does. Each `.eml` is read once per input row and the same
byte snapshot is hashed and analyzed. No paths, message content, or per-message
fingerprints appear in the report. The aggregate digest identifies data; it is
not an anonymization guarantee. Wilson intervals still require representative,
independent samples beyond this exact-duplicate check.

The evaluator uses the committed Vercel profile and ignores ambient application
environment variables. Authentication service IDs default to an empty trust list.
Only for mail whose receiving system's header-handling boundary has been verified,
add `--trusted-authserv-id mx.example` (repeat the flag for multiple IDs).
This makes the trust decision explicit; the flag does not authenticate the header.
External sender-history observation remains disabled.

The command loads the digest-verified committed artifact and uses the same
local analysis path as the API, with external sender-history observation
disabled. `eml_path` uses the byte-preserving message parser; `raw_email` uses
the legacy Unicode parser and cannot restore bytes lost during earlier decoding.
It prints aggregate counts and rates overall, by provider, by
language, by received month, by provider×language, and by provider×month;
message bodies and sender addresses are not included in the report. Medium,
High, and Critical are counted as alerts, while Unknown is undetermined and
remains in the phishing-recall denominator. Each group reports phishing and
legitimate denominators alongside two-sided Wilson 95% intervals for recall,
false-alert rate, unknown rate, complete rate, and model-available rate. A
label-specific rate and interval are null when that group has no examples of
the label. Small groups produce wide intervals, so avoid interpreting a point
estimate alone as provider or language performance.
The `reproducibility` section records the effective trust IDs and history policy,
Git commit and dirty state, source/registry digest, deployment-profile digest,
Python version, platform, and core inference/parser package versions. The source
digest includes local edits, so a dirty working tree is not represented solely by
its last commit. Git fields may be null in an exported source tree without Git.
This metadata describes the evaluation run, not the original training environment
or the configuration of a separately deployed service.
Keep the output local: a small provider×month or provider×language cell can
still disclose sensitive cohort information if published. The report marks
temporal isolation `not_verified`: dates alone do not prove training-family
separation. No real Gmail/Outlook cohort is committed or measured here, so the
offline table above must not be presented as provider-specific serving recall.
For a future independent cohort, obtain consent and labels before inspecting
model outputs. Keep a private campaign/family identifier and labeling record
outside the repository, exclude training-family overlap, and reserve a later
campaign-separated sample that is not used for threshold selection. Run this
tool only after that split is fixed; its Wilson intervals describe message
counts and do not correct for repeated messages within a campaign.

The included public Render profile still keeps the optional text model disabled
until a representative, versioned artifact is supplied through a trusted build
process. Rules and message-structure analysis remain available without it.

## Testing

GitHub Actions runs the development suite on both Python 3.12 and 3.13,
including HTML recovery regressions that must not depend on standard-library
exceptions. Original-byte evaluation parsing is tested on both versions without
loading the committed model. Tests that load that Python 3.12 artifact are skipped
on incompatible interpreters; the loader's version checks remain enforced.
A separate Python 3.12 job installs the root Vercel dependencies,
checks their consistency, verifies the committed model digest, starts the real
Lite profile with ML enabled, and performs phishing-positive and legitimate-
negative prediction smoke tests. It also uploads original MIME bytes for a
phishing positive control and an uncertain-rendering control.
A lint job runs pinned `ruff` with `ruff.toml`, which enables only syntax
errors and pyflakes defects (undefined names, unused imports and variables);
style rules and exploratory notebooks are out of scope.
Versioned static URLs (`/static/app.js?v=46`) are cached by browsers for a day,
so a changed file needs a new `?v=`. `website/tools/asset-versions/manifest.json`
pins each versioned file's version and SHA-256, and
`website/static/asset-versions.test.mjs` fails when a file changes without a
bump. After editing such a file, run
`node website/tools/asset-versions/update.mjs`: it bumps the integer `?v=`
everywhere the file is referenced (repeating when a bump changes another
versioned file, such as `vision.js` referencing `vision-worker.mjs`) and
rewrites the manifest. Non-integer versions such as Chart.js `4.4.0` are
changed by hand.
A separate deployment-status workflow checks the completed public Vercel
deployment's commit SHA, model digest, and JSON and raw `.eml` controls rather
than assuming that the source checkout represents its bundle. It performs six
POST requests when sender-history checks are enabled, within the committed
10-per-minute per-client limit when no other traffic shares the same rate-limit
bucket.
A `visual` CI job compares 17 screenshots of the homepage (navbar and hero,
sender and content results, a Chinese result, the 390 px menu and the 404 page,
in light and dark at 1280 and 390 px) with committed baselines. It runs in the
pinned Playwright container, serves `website/static/` with a small Node server
and answers the API from fixtures captured from the real backend. Baselines come
only from that container, through the manual **Visual baselines** workflow; see
`website/tools/visual/README.md`.

```bash
# From repository root, after installing requirements-dev.txt
python -m unittest discover -s website/tests -v
python -m compileall -q website phishing-detection/src
python -m pip install ruff==0.16.9 && ruff check .   # optional local lint gate
node --test website/static/app.test.mjs website/static/i18n.test.mjs website/static/cases.test.mjs website/static/page-loading.test.mjs website/static/request.test.mjs

node website/tools/asset-versions/update.mjs   # after editing a versioned static file
git diff --check
```

The regression suite covers sender-score semantics, authentication-service
trust, protected-brand/IDN and digit-substitution impersonation, Public Suffix
registrable-domain parsing, SMTP public-address enforcement,
bounded rate limiting, verified model artifacts, HTML destination mismatch,
ASCII brand lookalikes, URL userinfo, attachment MIME types, raw-message sender
fusion, footer spoofing, regional-language neutrality, conservative evidence
fusion, group isolation, deployment flags, and frontend payload/rendering
behavior. Disposable-address regressions cover multi-label provider domains,
random-looking Gmail and Outlook mailboxes, versioned privacy relays,
provider-aware plus aliases, Gmail/Googlemail dot variants, and custom-domain
local parts that must not be merged without known provider semantics.

## Historical benchmark results

These values come from the UCI **website** notebook and are preserved for course
reproducibility only:

| Classifier | Accuracy | F1 | ROC AUC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Random Forest | 0.9747 | 0.9746 | 0.9977 |
| SVM (RBF) | 0.9516 | 0.9515 | 0.9893 |
| Decision Tree | 0.9480 | 0.9480 | 0.9865 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9285 | 0.9284 | 0.9808 |

Do not use these numbers to describe sender-address or full-email detection.

### Team case workspace

Case creation retains its original submission for safe retries after uncertain
failures, while keeping later edits as a separate draft. Retained EML feedback
also has a decoded text preview with parsing warnings; original evidence is unchanged.
Private evaluation reports support the same-cohort release comparison described
in [the evaluation guide](docs/evaluation.md#3-compare-a-baseline-before-release).

The optional `/cases` workspace adds authenticated case creation, evidence review,
human verdicts, status changes and operation history. Vercel requires persistent
Upstash storage; the feature is disabled until configured. See
[case workflow and deployment instructions](docs/case-workflow.md) for access,
limits, retention and production setup. That guide includes a single-analyst
credential recovery mode, a private Production login check, and read-only case
and feedback archive export with an isolated local recovery drill. Separately
consented, closed user feedback with structured analyst review can be exported
as a private curation draft and combined with independent annotations into
private development and holdout inputs. An archive-first, confirmation-gated
operator tool can remove one eligible closed record and its indexes. These
tools do not automatically train or validate the model. See [evaluation scope](docs/evaluation.md).

The workspace also shows counts of open/closed feedback and evidence-supported
review findings, with verdict and review-reason filters. These counts describe
retained reports, not model-wide error rates. Per-case history capacity reserves
history slots and byte space for final workflow steps, and repeated Jev saves
preserve review conflicts. Failed page loads retain the current page for retry.
If the last filtered page disappears after a review, the queue returns to a valid
page with one bounded extra read. Public feedback keeps submission receipts and
original retry keys when edits are made during a request or the report dialog is
closed and reopened for the same analysis. Confirmed receipts remain available;
use **Start new report** to send another report, with fresh consent for retaining
input or using it in evaluation. These states remain in page memory only;
refreshing the page or replacing the analysis clears them. Archives account for
JSON escaping at full workspace capacity and retain complete restore verification.
Contradictory review reasons and verdicts cannot be closed or enter evaluation drafts.

## Image and QR recognition

On **Email Content** or **Case workspace → New case**, select a PNG/JPEG/WebP
image or an original `.eml` file. You can also drop one file onto the upload area,
or click/focus that area and paste a screenshot with Ctrl/Cmd+V. Selecting a file
does not submit it; use the existing analysis button when ready. The browser runs self-hosted jsQR and Tesseract.js
with **Image text language (OCR)** set to **English** by default. Select **Simplified
Chinese** or **English + Chinese** for those images. This is a manual language
choice, not automatic detection; changing it cancels the current scan. Language
selection affects image text only, including embedded EML images, not QR decoding
or original email text. Check extracted text even when confidence is high.
When OCR sees a URL-like line, the result shows that line's own recognition
confidence separately from the overall image confidence. A high value is still
not proof of the address's spelling; compare it character by character with the
original image. The displayed number is client-extracted evidence and does not
change risk scoring or repair `1`/`l` lookalikes.
In **Email Content**, for a directly uploaded image, expand **Original uploaded image** beside the
result to inspect its characters at native resolution. The preview uses a
temporary URL in the current browser only. By default, the original image bytes
are not included in the analysis request, saved case or feedback. When the optional
enhanced recognition checkbox is selected, the image bytes are submitted once to
the configured image service; they are still not saved with a case. Clearing or replacing
the result revokes that URL. Saved cases and EML-embedded images do not have a local preview.
The browser extracts EML images with postal-mime. Results
show each image's QR payloads, OCR text, OCR confidence and extraction warnings.
Each decoded HTML MIME part is parsed separately so unclosed markup cannot
hide an image in a later part or combine fragments into a nonexistent image.
The submission and nested messages share a 64-part / 2 Mi-character HTML budget;
excess parts produce an incomplete-coverage warning while earlier evidence and
image attachments remain available. The part adapter uses pinned postal-mime
3.0.0 internals and must be rechecked when that dependency changes.
CID image references are checked against Content-ID metadata in their own MIME
context. Missing, ambiguous, malformed, empty or unsupported targets produce
coverage warnings. Percent escapes are decoded once and identifier case is
preserved. References cannot borrow images from a nested message, a parallel
related group or a mutually exclusive alternative. An inner related group can
use an enclosing related group's resource. Without related groups, matching is
limited to local candidates in the same message. This checks resource metadata,
not client rendering or successful image decoding; format, image-count and OCR
limits still apply. The bounded matcher permits 4,096 MIME nodes, 32 nesting
levels, 4,096 unique lookups and 200,000 candidate/path steps per parsed message;
reaching a limit reports incomplete coverage while attachment scanning continues.
Inline HTML images are collected with self-hosted HTML/CSS syntax parsers.
Comments, scripts, templates, literal examples and non-resource attributes do
not supply image evidence. Actual image sources, responsive candidates, CSS
image values and one layer of Outlook conditional markup remain inspectable.
CSS selectors, cascade and client-specific display are not verified; those
candidates carry a rendering warning. HTML is never inserted into a page or
executed, and remote resources are not fetched. Parsing stops with an incomplete
coverage warning at 128 open elements, 256 attributes per tag or 20,000 node/text
construction operations; earlier collected candidates can still be inspected.
Successfully decoded QR quadrilaterals are whitened in a separate OCR image so
their patterns do not contribute invented text. This preserves adjacent text
outside the polygon, the original input digest and the literal QR payloads;
undecodable regions remain available to OCR. Sparse-text recognition is retained
for scattered captions. No OCR URL spelling or lookalike characters are repaired.
Decoded links are plain text; the app never opens them. See
[asset sources and licenses](website/tools/vision-assets/README.md).

Limits: 2 MiB input file, four distinct images per submission, 4,096 pixels per side and
8 megapixels before decoding, eight QR codes per image, 6,000 OCR characters per
image. QR scanning uses original pixels within those bounds; only the masked OCR
copy is resized above 2,000 pixels, with a small-text warning. One job has
a 150-second deadline. OCR startup and parameter setup share a 45-second
deadline; image encoding and recognition share 20 seconds per image. If either
OCR stage fails or times out, the task stops attempting OCR on later images,
continues QR scanning and returns the original EML and any extracted evidence.
Each affected image reports that its text was not checked; it is partial when
a QR was decoded and failed otherwise. A damaged image does not disable OCR
for other decodable images. A new scan can try OCR again. These stage deadlines
do not guarantee completion on every device; the overall cancellation limit remains.
Cancel, clear, file changes and case sign-out discard pending results. Recent
browsers supporting Workers, OffscreenCanvas and WebAssembly are required.
Exact image bytes share one slot across inline images, attachments and nested
messages; another distinct image beyond the limit produces a coverage warning.
Animated WebP and animated PNG (APNG) are rejected with a still-image instruction.
PNG chunk framing is checked before decoding; this is not full CRC or pixel validation. Remote images,
SVG/GIF/PDF, attachment malware and general visual meaning are outside scope.

`POST /api/analyze-visual` and authenticated `POST /api/cases/visual` accept
`subject`, `body`, optional original bytes in `eml_base64`, and bounded
`observations`/`warnings`. Each observation includes `name`, `source`, `mime_type`,
`sha256`, `status`, `qr_payloads`, `ocr_text`, `ocr_confidence`, optional
`ocr_url_line_confidence` (0–100 or null), and `warnings`.
Their request limit is 3 MiB; other endpoint limits are unchanged. The server
rescans extracted strings as **literal text**, preserves original-message risk,
and marks browser extraction `browser_extracted_unverified`. Digests identify
client-observed bytes; they do not authenticate OCR output. OCR text and each
distinct nonempty QR payload are scored independently, then the strongest
individual risk is retained. Separate sources cannot form a new sentence or
negate each other's requests. Responses identify this as `independent-source-max`
and report `assessed_source_count`; the displayed multi-source model score is the
highest individual source score. Scores are not summed across sources. At most
36 nonempty sources are analyzed per request (four images, each with OCR plus
eight QR payloads).
Server-produced risk
cannot be overridden by client verdict fields. No image-safety guarantee is made,
even when OCR/QR finds no indicators; visual submissions remain incomplete.

### Optional enhanced image recognition

An independent local [RapidOCR service](website/tools/enhanced_vision/README.md)
can provide a second literal OCR reading of **one directly uploaded image**.
The service is disabled by default. When enabled, the UI asks for explicit consent
before submitting original image bytes. EML attachments, pasted remote URLs and
the default browser path are unaffected. The additional OCR text, model-generated
observations (when separately enabled), extractor identity, image digest and URL
disagreement appear next to the original browser OCR/QR results. They do **not**
change the risk verdict or replace the browser's literal text or QR payloads.
They remain unverified evidence; users must compare important addresses with the
original pixels. A service failure leaves browser findings intact.

The image service and its ONNX dependencies are intentionally excluded from the
Vercel runtime requirements. The production endpoint may only be configured with
an HTTPS URL and server-side token. The local HTTP example is for development;
the service itself binds only to `127.0.0.1`. Exposing it to a deployment requires
a separately administered private HTTPS gateway. Do not configure a public
image-upload destination without an appropriate privacy review.

The [comparison CLI](website/tools/vision-benchmark/README.md) uses exact
manifest hashes, OCR character error rate and literal URL sets. Existing five
synthetic controls are diagnostic, not a measure of phishing accuracy or an
adoption decision. QR and risk metrics are not evaluated by the additional
OCR-only runner.
For future adoption decisions, the [local holdout preparation workflow](website/tools/vision-benchmark/README.md#prepare-a-reviewed-email-screenshot-holdout)
creates a hashed manifest from manually transcribed, independently reviewed
email screenshots without uploading the images or using either OCR engine as
ground truth.

Original EML bytes are decoded server-side with a shared 60,000-character text
budget; truncation is reported. The UI never converts EML bytes through UTF-8
before transmission. Original image/attachment bytes are not retained in cases;
extracted visual evidence, its provenance and the input digest are retained.
Submitting a public analysis does not create a case. API callers without a browser
must provide their own extraction or use the existing text/MIME-only routes.

### Experimental Jev auxiliary opinions

The authenticated case workspace can request a separate TypeSafe Jev text opinion.
It is **disabled by default** and never changes the saved risk, verdict or detection
evidence. An analyst can explicitly save a structured opinion to case history.
Enabling requires `PHISHGUARD_JEV_ENABLED=true` and a server-side
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; each request also requires the analyst's explicit permission
to send the message text to TypeSafe. The public analyzer never calls Jev.

The panel displays disabled, invalid-configuration and storage-control states;
**Refresh** updates the status without signing out or discarding review notes.
`PHISHGUARD_JEV_DAILY_LIMIT` defaults to **20 attempts per UTC day** (1–1000).
All web instances share the workspace/environment budget through existing
Upstash storage (or SQLite locally). Identical requests by the same analyst reuse
a structured receipt for 24 hours, including failures and uncertain outcomes.
**View existing result** reads the analyst's current cached result without a new
provider call or quota use, even while Jev is disabled. **Save opinion to history**
requires confirmation and retains a successful result under the case retention
policy, with its model, input digest and question digest. Saved opinions are
visible to workspace analysts and remain after the temporary cache expires.
Confirmed local worker-capacity rejections make no provider call and release
their reservation for a later manual retry.
No email text is added to these receipts. See [operations](docs/case-workflow.md#jev-availability-and-request-controls)
for retention and reset behavior. Production smoke checks configuration without
contacting TypeSafe; this does not verify provider access or model accuracy.

The adapter pins `jev-1.13.0`, uses the official HTTP endpoint without an added
Python dependency, and asks separate questions about secret disclosure, changed
payment destinations, pressure to bypass checks, deceptive intent and missing
evidence. These are model opinions, not verified findings. Jev cannot inspect
images or repair OCR spelling, and multilingual performance is unverified here.

Before enabling, run the [shadow evaluation workflow](docs/evaluation.md#jev-shadow-evaluation)
and configure provider-side spending controls. No live Jev accuracy result is
included. TypeSafe skill installation guides the coding agent; it does not install
model weights, create an API account or enable inference.
